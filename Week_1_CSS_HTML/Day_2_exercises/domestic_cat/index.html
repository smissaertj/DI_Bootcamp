    <h2>About domestic cats</h2>
        <p>
            They are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to
            distinguish them from other felids and felines. They are often valued by humans for
            <strong>companionship</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are more than seventy cat breeds recognized by various cat registries..

            Cats were venerated in ancient Egypt, but there may have been instances of domestication as early as the
            Neolithic from around 9,500 years ago (7500 BC).  Did you know that, The felids are a rapidly evolving
            family of mammals that includes:

    <h1 id="lions">The lions</h1>
        <p>
            Present in Africa and India, the lion typically inhabits grasslands and savannahs, but is absent in dense
            forests. It is usually more diurnal than other big cats, but when persecuted adapts to being active at
            night and at twilight. A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs. Prides vary
            in size and composition from three to 20 adult lions, depending on habitat and prey availability.
            Females cooperate when hunting and prey mostly on large ungulates, including antelope, deer, buffalo,
            zebra and even giraffe.
