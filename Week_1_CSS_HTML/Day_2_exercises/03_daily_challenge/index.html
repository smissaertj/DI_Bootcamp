            <h1>Captain America</h1>
            <p>
                Captain America is the alter ego of Steve Rogers, a frail young artist enhanced to the peak of human
                perfection by an experimental "super-soldier serum" after joining the military to aid the United States
                government's efforts in World War II. Near the end of the war, he was trapped in ice and survived in
                suspended animation until he was revived in modern times. Although Captain America often struggles to
                maintain his ideals as a man out of his time, he remains a highly respected figure both with the
                American public and in the superhero community, which includes becoming the long-time
                leader of the Avengers.
